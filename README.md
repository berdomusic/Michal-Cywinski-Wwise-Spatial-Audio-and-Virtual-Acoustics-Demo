 <b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b> This project does NOT have a WwiseReflect licence and because of that it will work properly ONLY with Wwise Authoring connected.
 
This is a simple demo of Wwise Spatial Audio and Virtual Acoustics. The purpose is to show example settings of AkRoom, AkRoomPortals and AkSurfaceReflectors.
You can move around, play some test sounds, enable reflection drawing for emitters etc. There are some audio scripts (key binding, reflection drawing), feel free to use them.
